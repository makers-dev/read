# Read

Read code, get better.

## Why

Reading good stuff is a good way to figure out how to write good stuff. As coders, we spend a lot of time reading code but there's no training out there to help us do it well. Even a 10% improvement at a programmer's ability to read code would translate into significant time savings in a short space of time.

## How

MVP.

- Load a file by cloning a GH repo containing some examples
- Add line-by-line comments with a text editor
- Add a file-wide comment with a commit
- Can see others’ solutions by making a PR and viewing pull requests

## Roadmap

Overall idea:

- Can load up a random new file
- Can do line-by-line comments explaining what something is and how it works
- Can do a file-wide comment
- Can see others’ approaches and discuss

Clearly, some sort of web app would be a good basis to get started. Some sort of open-source [code review tool](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-5-open-source-and-commercial-secure-code-review-tools) might accelerate development.
